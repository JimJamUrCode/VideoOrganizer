# VideoOrganizer
Organizes a collection of videos, regardless of type or location.

I finally decided to get my own domain, so now updates should work more seamlessly, although you are going to need to do a manual update once more to finally get your updates from my domain.

Version 1.0.0.64 is now live, and it includes major bug fixes for auto loading, so download now!

This program was created to organize a video library. A user can load multiple directories of files into the program. From their, the list is loaded in alphabetical order. File properties are listed for the selected file. A total number of files is also displayed. A user can save the loaded directories to a file, this makes it so you can load huge libraries just by selecting your save file. The save file only contains the directories which you loaded, so it is very small in size.
